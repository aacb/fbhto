FBHTO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================

fbhto has a simple make script to install it. If you use a Debian GNU/Linux
machine, you just need to run as root:

cd <fbhto-source-directory>
make

and that's done.

In some other cases, you may want to install everything under the /usr/local
directory, for example. To do this, edit the Makefile and just change the
variable:

PREFIX?=

to

PREFIX?=/usr/local

then run:

make

and that's done as well.

TO UNINSTALL
============

To uninstall fbhto, just run:

cd <fbhto-source-directory>
make uninstall
